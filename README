IPC-Open2-Simple

IPC::Open2::Simple allows you to pipe data to a child process and read
its ouput (STDOUT), all in one line! Contrary to IPC::Open2, you do not
need to use file handles to communicate with the child process, which makes
things a lot easier.

WARNING! This module only works for simple use cases like the one in the
synopsis, where the program called receives only 1 input and will print the
output to STDOUT immediately and exit. STDERR is ignored and there is no
timeout, so you should only use this module with programs and data you trust,
or else your program  might get stuck.

While this module has much less features than IPC::Run, it does not suffer
from all its bugs and memory leaks, which make IPC::Run unusable in servers.
IPC::Open2::Simple is also much more lightweight and has no non-core
dependencies.
